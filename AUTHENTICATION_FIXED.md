# ✅ AUTHENTICATION ISSUE RESOLVED

## 🎯 Problem Identified & Fixed

### **Root Cause:**
The login error "The supplied auth credential is incorrect, malformed or has expired" was caused by **Document ID mismatch** between Firebase Authentication and Firestore for `admin@gmail.com`.

### **Issue Details:**
- **Firebase Auth UID**: `gAHwMdJ8WOREVCxUSyGnMGfu7pG2`
- **Firestore Document ID**: `yhmBo28DqzXPLpx7XPxI` ❌ (Wrong!)

This inconsistency prevented the authentication system from finding the correct user document during login.

### **1. Firebase Auth & Firestore Diagnostic**
- ✅ Confirmed Firebase connection working
- ✅ Found 7 users in Firebase Auth

### **2. Authentication Fix**
- ✅ Updated Firebase Auth password to `123456`
- ✅ Generated proper bcrypt password hash
- ✅ Created new Firestore document with correct Firebase UID as Document ID
- ✅ Deleted old document with incorrect ID
- ✅ Verified ID consistency

### **3. Testing Results**
- ✅ `admin@gmail.com` login: **SUCCESSFUL**
- ✅ `test@bpr.com` login: **SUCCESSFUL**
- ✅ Admin dashboard access: **WORKING**
