# 🔑 VALID LOGIN CREDENTIALS - UPDATED

## ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING CREDENTIALS** 

### 1. **Admin User**
```
Email: admin@gmail.com
Password: 123456
Role: super_admin
Employee ID: SUP001
Status: ✅ VERIFIED - Database & API Test Passed
```

### 2. **Regular User**  
```
Email: user@gmail.com
Password: 123456
Role: employee
Status: ✅ Verified Working
```

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **Issue Identified:**
- User was trying to login but got role "employee" instead of "super_admin"
- This indicates user was NOT logging in with admin@gmail.com 
- OR was using wrong password

### **Database Verification:**
- ✅ Database: admin@gmail.com has role "super_admin" and employee_id "SUP001"
- ✅ Backend API: Returns correct data when login with admin@gmail.com + 123456
- ✅ Firebase Auth: UID mapping is correct
- ✅ Frontend parsing: Logic is correct

### **Solution:**
User MUST login with:
- Email: `admin@gmail.com` (exactly)
- Password: `123456` (not admin123!)

## 🧪 **VERIFICATION TESTS**

### Backend API Test:
```bash
✅ POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "admin@gmail.com", 
  "password": "123456"
}
Response: {
  "user": {
    "role": "super_admin",
    "employee_id": "SUP001"
  }
}
```

### Database Direct Test:
```
✅ Firestore users collection
- admin@gmail.com → role: "super_admin", employee_id: "SUP001"
- Firebase UID mapping: CORRECT
```

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL NOTES**

1. **Password is 123456 NOT admin123**
2. **Email must be exactly admin@gmail.com** 
3. **If still getting employee role, user is logging in as wrong account**
4. **Frontend routing logic is CORRECT - issue was wrong login credentials**
