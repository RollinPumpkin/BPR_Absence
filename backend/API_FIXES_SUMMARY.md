# 🎉 API FIXES COMPLETED - Testing Summary

## ✅ RESOLVED ISSUES

### 1. **Authentication Fixed**
- **Problem**: `test@bpr.com` account was disabled and had invalid credentials
- **Solution**: Used `user@gmail.com` with properly hashed password
- **Result**: ✅ Login working successfully

### 2. **API Token Authentication Fixed**
- **Problem**: JWT token not being properly passed in requests  
- **Solution**: Fixed middleware auth to support both Firebase and JWT tokens with `userId` field
- **Result**: ✅ All authenticated endpoints now working

### 3. **Dashboard API Endpoints Working**
- ✅ `/api/dashboard/user` - User dashboard data
- ✅ `/api/dashboard/user/activity` - User activity summary  
- ✅ `/api/dashboard/widgets/recent-activities` - Recent activities
- ✅ `/api/attendance/` - User attendance records
- ✅ `/api/attendance/today` - Today's attendance
